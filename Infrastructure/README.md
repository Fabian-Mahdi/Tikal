# Start Developing

- Install [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install).

- Install the needed providers

<pre>
terraform init
</pre>

- Make sure to define all variables that are mentioned in "./variables.tf"

- Start planning and applying your changes

This operation will yield the needed "vpn_application_id" (see variables.tf).
